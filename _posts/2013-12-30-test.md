Hello world!

I'm kind of disappointed that this engine doesn't support reStructuredText,
which is my choice when it comes to writing stuff.

I do write stuff on my laptop, and I was thinking of quickly pasting the
OpenSource development related stuff in here, after minor refactors, but
having a rst->md transform bothers me a little (yes I do have pandoc installed).
