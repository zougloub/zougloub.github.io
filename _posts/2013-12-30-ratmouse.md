This is actually kind of old, but today I took my only mouse from my desktop
and put it on the laptop, which made me revisit a problem that hasn't been solved.

I'm the "proud" owner of a fancy mouse (R.A.T. 7) which is quite comfortable.
I'm far from being a gamer, not even a big mouse user, but sometimes it's quite convenient to use this input device.

Anyway, if you put this particular mouse on a computer as of today, some weird things will happen:

- The button with the cyborg face is not properly handled.
  The HW guys decided to have this button operate like a selector switch,
  for mouse modes.
- Other weird focus issues

For the cyborg face button, the Linux evdev driver reports (*evtest* output):

This goes up the stack to X, with *xev* reporting the same thing.

There have been attempts to patch this particular problem, with some people
noticing the issue on Ubuntu:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-input-evdev/+bug/615892

The idea was to transform this mode button into a regular button.
Well almost, because it would have auto-release.

* A kernel patch was developed, but only for one kind of mouse;
* A xf86-input-evdev autorelease patch was made, enabling to configure
  xorg to work around the issue on your hardware (understandable,
  this hardware is quite rare and if you're crazy enough to use it on Linux,
  you should be prepared for the consequences.... but not even,
  because a xorg.conf.d patch could be released by user-friendly distros)

  An xf86-input-evdev bug tracks this:
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32200

  Should the proposed patch be integrated, you'd have to edit a
  configuration file with:

		Option "AutoReleaseButtons" "13 14 15"

Anyway, since I don't use the device a lot, I did:

{% highlight bash %}
  xinput set-prop "Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.7 Contagion" \
   "Evdev Wheel Emulation" 1
  xinput set-prop "Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.7 Contagion" \
   "Evdev Wheel Emulation Button" 12
  xinput set-prop "Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.7 Contagion" \
   "Evdev Wheel Emulation Axes" 7 6 4 5
  xinput set-button-map "Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.7 Contagion" \
   1 2 3 4 5 7 6 5 4 7 6 12 0 0 0 16 17
{% endhighlight %}

This configures the mouse to:

- scroll horizontally with the horizontal scroll;
- scroll vertically with the other scrolling buttons;
- use the thumb button ("target") for scrolling emulation

It's possible to do fancy things but this is too much already.

Note that the mouse properties can be given by:

{% highlight bash %}
  # what's its name already?
  xinput
  # what properties can I change?
  xinput list-props "Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.7 Contagion"
  # what happens if I click on ...?
  xinput test "Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.7 Contagion"
  # Same but better
  xev
{% endhighlight %}
