So, I wanted to have a meaningless entry, and went for inspiration on the web.
Crawling from link to link, I finally managed to gett to [the Bubble Babble specification](http://web.mit.edu/kenta/www/one/bubblebabble/spec/jrtrjwzi/draft-huima-01.txt).

Bubble Babble is a data codec, its encoded data consists in 5-tuples of utterable (but meaningless) words.

It is quite useless, and that's why, as a big enthusiast for pointless stuff, such as libcaca, ansicat, fuckit, brainfuck, ...) I decided to make a [bubblebabble Python module](https://gitorious.org/python-bubblebabble/python-bubblebabble).
